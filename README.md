**Key Insights:**
- **Cloud-agnostic is actually cheaper** across all traffic levels
- Cloudflare's generous free tiers (D1, KV, CDN) provide significant cost savings
- Cost advantage increases at lower traffic volumes
- AWS-native has higher baseline costs due to RDS/ElastiCache minimums
- Cloud-agnostic eliminates vendor lock-in while being more cost-effective

**Cloud-Agnostic Benefits:**
- **Lower costs** especially at low-medium traffic
- No vendor lock-in - can switch providers easily
- Cloudflare Pro includes enterprise-grade CDN, security, and performance
- D1 (SQLite-based) and KV storage scale seamlessly
- Simpler architecture without VPC complexity
- Better global performance with Cloudflare's edge network
